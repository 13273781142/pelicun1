    Describes the relationship between asset response and damage.
    
    Asset response is characterized by a Demand value that represents an 
    engineering demand parameter (EDP). Only a scalar EDP is supported 
    currently. The damage is characterized by a set of DamageStateGroup (DSG)
    objects. For each DSG, the corresponding EDP limit (i.e. the EDP at which
    the asset is assumed to experience damage described by the DSG) is 
    considered uncertain; hence, it is described by a random variable. The 
    random variables that describe EDP limits for the set of DSGs are not 
    independent. 
    
    We assume that the EDP limit will be approximated by a normal or lognormal 
    distribution for each DSG and these variables together form a multivariate
    normal distribution. Following common practice, the correlation between
    variables is assumed perfect by default, but the framework allows the
    users to explore other, more realistic options. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    RVS: RandomVariableSubset
        A multidimensional random variable that might be defined as a subset
        of a bigger correlated group of variables or a complete set of 
        variables created only for this Fragility Function (FF). The number of 
        dimensions shall be equal to the number of DSGs handled by the

class DamageStateGroup(object):
    """
    Collects component damages that are controlled by the same kind of EDP and 
    occur at the same EDP magnitude. The damages are characterized by Damage
    States (DS). A Damage State Group (DSG) might have only a single DS in the
    simplest case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ID: int
    DS_set: DamageState array
    DS_set_kind: {'single', 'mutually_exclusive', 'simultaneous'}
        Specifies the relationship among the DS in the set. When only one DS is
        defined, use the 'single' option to improve calculation efficiency. 
        When multiple DS are present, the 'mutually_exclusive' option assumes
        that the occurrence of one DS precludes the occurrence of another DS.
        In such a case, the weights of the DS in the set shall sum up to 1.0.
        In a 'simultaneous' case the DS are independent and unrelated. Hence,
        they can occur at the same time and at least one of them has to occur.
    fragility_function: FragilityFunction
        This fragility function describes the probability that the damage in 
        the component will meet or exceed the damages described by the DS_set.

    Characterizes a set of structural or non-structural components that have

    similar probability of incurring those modes of damage, and similar 
    potential consequences resulting from their damage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ID: int
    kind: {'structural','non-structural'}
        Defines the type of components in the Fragility Group (FG).
    demand_type: {'PID', 'PFA', 'PSD', 'PSA', 'ePGA', 'PGD'}
        The type of Engineering Demand Parameter (EDP) that controls the damage 
        of the components in the FG. See Demand for acronym descriptions.
    DSG_set: DamageStateGroup array
        A set of sequential Damage State Groups that describe the plausible set
        of damage states of the components in the FG.
    directional: bool, optional, default: True
        Determines whether the components in the FG are sensitive to the 
        directionality of the EDP.   
    correlation: bool, optional, default: True
        Determines whether the components within a Performance Group (PG) will
        have correlated or uncorrelated damage. Correlated damage means that 
        all components will have the same damage state. In the uncorrelated 
        case, each component in the performance group will have its damage
        state evaluated independently. Correlated damage reduces the required 
        computational effort for the calculation. Incorrect correlation 
        modeling will only slightly affect the mean estimates, but might 
        significantly change their dispersion. 
    demand_location_offset: int, optional, default: 0
        Indicates if the location for the demand shall be different from the 
        location of the components. Damage to components of the ceiling, for 
        example, is controlled by demands on the floor above the one that the
        components belong to. This can be indicated by setting the 
        demand_location_offset to 1 for such an FG.
    incomplete: bool, optional, default: False
        Indicates that the FG information is not complete and corresponding
        results shall be treated with caution.
    description: str, optional, default: ''
